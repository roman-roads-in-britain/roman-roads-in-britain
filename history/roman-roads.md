## Roman Britain Invasion

Claudius was the Roman Emperor who successfully led an invasion into England, and Aulus Plautius was the Roman general in charge of it. Julius Caesar had prepared for invasion before him, but it was Claudius who brought troops into England. They invaded around 43 CE and were a part of the Empire until the 5th century CE.
There are a few different locations that historians and archaeologists debate over for possible departure and arrival locations in Britain. The most widely accepted place of embarkation is Boulogne, and the other possible places are from the mouths of the Somme River and Seine River. The two places they could have landed were either Richborough or Chichester, and each of these places provided different military advancements.

***Richborough***:
If they landed in Richborough, then they took a short and more direct route to Colchester. They marched along the North Downs and crossed the Thames River near London. Then took over Colchester.

***Chichester***:
If they landed in Chichester then aim was to restore the Pro-Roman kingdom of the Atrebates in Southern Britain. Then travel North to the Thames River and down the valley into Catuvellauni territory. Then finally capturing Colchester which was the capital of the Catuvellauni.

Aulus Plautius summoned Claudius when they were about to deliver the final assault on Colchester. According to Cassio Dio Claudius arrived with his Praetorian cohorts and war elephants for it, and after 11 British Kings surrendered to Emperor Claudius.

## Roads

In Italy there were already remnants of roads existing from the Greeks and Etruscans. These roads contributed to trade and communication routes. As the Romans started to expand their territory outside of Italy and into Europe, they needed a way to easily transport armies to gain and sustain newly claimed territories. This prompted the need to construct roads in Europe. When they invaded Britain in 43 CE this was still true for the construction of the roads. The roads constructed in Britain were meant to create easy mobility for armies and a good military communication system. The emphasis was on connecting military forts together for those reasons. Many of the roads start from where they landed in Britain such as Richborough and Chichester, go to London, and from there to Colchester. As they progressed through Britain more roads started to extend out connecting other forts and settlements to the North to Hadrian's Wall and to the West in modern day Wales.
