This map shows different routes that the LCPs generated from the computer that take into account the topographical information only. There is this triangle shape that is formed by the paths that go from Durovigutum to Shiptonthrope. According to Lewisâ€™ map the road of higher importance for transferring communication is the path on the left. However there are more paths generated by my project model for LCPs for the road on the right. This can only leave us to believe that the roads may have been created in regards to the topography for ease but the ones that became of higher importance and were used more were not always the best and most efficient route by on costs. Here the road is not the best option cost wise to get to Shiptonthrope, but it is the better route due to the defenses of small towns that allow the road to be more secure for transferring information.
