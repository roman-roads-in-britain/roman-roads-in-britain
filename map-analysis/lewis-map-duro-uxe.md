Here is Lewis’ map displaying edge betweenness among his points for defended settlements. My LCPs highlight the section of roads from Durovigutum to Uxelodum where according to Lewis’ those roads have a high betweenness score. Therefore this section of roads are important to the communication system between these defended small towns. This means that these roads have some influence by cultural factors, and the LCPs that I generated will help to determine if there was also topographical influence from the landscape in the creation of the roads. By looking at the comparison between the known Roman roads, Lewis’ roads, and the LCPs, It can be concluded that the Romans did take into consideration the landscape for ease of transportation as most of the LCPs lay within the yellow buffed roads. That being said, another conclusion can be drawn that Lewis’ shows the increasing importance of these roads and the continual use of them. My LCPs provide conclusions on the creation process of these roads, and combined with the research of Lewis, it displays the purpose and which paths became popular main roads in Roman Britain.
