This map gives a look into all the LCPs in relation to the Roman roads, which are the purple buffed lines measuring at 5 km (~3 miles). This gives insight to see where the LCPs show high probability of a road because the thicker lines are LCPs that share the same route. It also shows which roads were heavily influenced by the topography of the area because those thick lines also overlap with the purple buffed roads. It can be seen that many of the roads, especially the main roads that go North to South and East to West share similar routes to the LCPs that were generated. Therefore roads that are meant for long distance travel across the territory followed the natural landscape for the most optimal path. This could be because when traveling long distances, it is best to pick the paths with the quickest and most easily navigable routes. This would be smart especially for thinking of future purposes of these roads, which would be for transferring information and transporting different goods all over the territory.
