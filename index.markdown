Click on the maps to explore the different paths of the Roman Empire. Each of the maps will show roads and least cost paths between points of interest such as military forts, settlements, temples, and markets. These paths focus on creating the best and shortest path from one point to another point based on terrain roughness and elevation. Other maps layered underneath the least cost paths represent the social and economic influences on the Roman roads. One highlights routes more frequently used for communication, and the other highlights routes more frequently used for food transportation and distribution. The last map shows the relationship between the Roman roads and the modern highway system in Britain toady. The interactive maps allows one to turn on and off the different layers on the map.
