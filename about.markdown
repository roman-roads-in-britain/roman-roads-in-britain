### **Project Abstract**

This project will be looking at the Roman roads in Britain to further understand the decisions that were made by the Romans during the construction of their roads. It starts off with a look into their roads in relation to the topography of the land. This is done by generating least cost paths based on the elevation and friction costs of the area to create the best paths to travel between forts, settlements, religious sites, and markets. The paths generated by least cost path analysis will be compared to the known Roman roads and the research by Joseph Lewis and Hector Orengo. The research that they conducted displays social and economic influences on the roads. These influences helped determine the decisions for choosing certain routes over other ones. Lewis’ roads focus on communication and transferring information, while Orengo’s research provides a look into roads that were commonly used for food trade and distribution. Considering both, the landscape and human behavior, can lead to a better understanding of the decisions that were made during the construction of the Roman roads. In the end, this project looks at the modern day implications of the Roman roads. Using QGIS, a map of modern highways in Britain can be overlaid on top of the maps produced in this project, and the maps produced by Lewis and Orengo. This provides insight into how the Roman roads paved the way for the modern highway system in Britain.

### **Website Description**

This project is in the form of a website to display interactive maps for the Roman road system in Britain. This website allows exploration of the different maps and regions for different points of interest. These maps provide information about the Roman roads and the least cost paths (LCPs) which were generated with QGIS for this project. The Home Page displays important web maps for comparisons that are the center of discussion in this project. One web map consists of several different maps layered on top of one another displaying the least cost paths and the research by Lewis and Orengo. The other map displays the modern highways in Britain with least cost paths and Roman roads. The Methods Page explains how the LCPs were generated in QGIS and the process of creating the project model for the computer to run these paths. The background and history page provides additional context regrading Roman Britain and the roads constructed. The Roman Britain Roads page is the focal point of this website. This page displays all the maps and research that was conducted. On that page, there is a display of maps that the user can click on those maps and explore more context about each of them. They represent the different areas that were discussed in this project. There are pages containing a map of the LCPs, maps with research by Lewis and Orengo that were overlaid on top of my own research, and a map for the modern highways with my research. Upon clicking on these maps, there is more information regarding the research along with more paths to click through for more areas of discussion. Within these pages, there are interactive maps that the user can click around and observe the main relevant points that are discussed. The web maps display a map of Britain to show an overview of the area of discussion. The web maps contain a legend with features that allow the user to turn on and off the different layers. This feature provides an interactive element that allows for different perspectives. There are also 3D interactive images of certain portions of the maps. The reason for this is because a major part of this project is about the landscape of Britain. Therefore, the 3D images allow the user to obtain a better grasp of the landscape in Britain. This website is meant to showcase the research and conclusions derived for this project in a way that was clear, understandable, and interactive.
