### **Project Abstract**

This project will be looking at the Roman roads in Britain to further understand the decisions that were made by the Romans during the construction of their roads. It starts off with a look into their roads in relation to the topography of the land. This is done by generating least cost paths based on the elevation and friction costs of the area to create the best paths to travel between forts, settlements, religious sites, and markets. These paths generated by least cost path analysis will be compared to the known Roman roads and research from Joseph Lewis and Hector Orengo. The research that they conducted displays social and economic influences on the roads that help to determine the influence and decisions for choosing certain routes over other ones. Lewis’ roads focus on communication and transferring information, while Orengo’s research provides a look into roads that were commonly used for food trade and distribution. Combining the influences of the landscape and human behavior can lead to a better understanding of the decisions that were made during the construction of the Roman roads. In the end, this project looks at the modern day implications of the Roman roads. Using QGIS, a map of modern highways in Britain can be overlaid on top of the maps produced in this project as well as maps produced by Lewis and Orengo. This provides insight into how the Roman roads laid the way for the modern highway system in Britain.

### **Website Description**

This project is in the form of a website to display interactive maps for the Roman road system in Roman Britain. This website allows one to explore the different maps and regions for different points of interest that provide information about the Roman roads and the least cost paths (LCPs) which were generated with QGIS for this project. The Home Page displays important web maps for comparisons that are the center of discussion in this project. One map consists of different layers placed on top of one another from the LCPs generated for this project as well as the maps from Lewis and Orengo containing their research. The other map displays the modern highways in Britain with least cost paths and Roman roads. The Methods Page explains how the LCPs were generated in QGIS and the process of creating the project model for the computer to run these paths. There is a page that provides some background and history about Roman Britain and the Roman roads for context. The focal point of this website is the page that displays all the maps and research that was conducted. On that page, there is a display of maps that were created and the user can click on those maps to explore more about each of them. They represent the different areas that were explored in this project. There is a page for the general LCPs that were created, the maps from Lewis and Orengo that were overlaid on top of my own maps for further exploration, and a map for the modern highways overlaid with my research. Upon clicking on these maps, there is more information regarding the research that was conducted along with more paths to click through for more areas of discussion. Within these pages, there are interactive maps that the user can click around and see some of the points I bring up in there as well. The web maps allowed for a view of the whole area and project with a way for the user to turn on and off different layers of the project so they can get a clearer picture of the information. There are also 3D interactive images of certain portions of the maps. The reason for this is because a major part of this project is about the topography and the landscape of Britain. Therefore the 3D images allow the user to obtain a better grasp of the landscape in Britain. This website is meant to showcase the research conducted for this project in a way that was clear, understandable, and interactive.
