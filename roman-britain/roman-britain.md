The map below is a web map that can be used to view relationships between the different layers (i.e. the different least cost paths, Roman roads, and maps illustrating communication routes and food distribution routes). Using the scroll bar at the bottom of the box and scrolling to the right, you can find the legend. The legend displays the different layers that are a part of this map. You can uncheck or check the boxes to change the visibility of the different layers. Below this web map is a collection of maps, which display different points of interest to highlight.
